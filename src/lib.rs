/// Solver for `P || C_max` task scheduling problem.
///
/// `P || C_max` is a `a|b|c` notation used in *operations research* where
///   1. `P` stands for **parallel identical resources**
///   2. `||` denotes that there are no task constraints, notably that **tasks are non-preemptive**
///   3. `C_max` means that the objective is to **minimize the maximum completion time** (makespan)
///
/// This task is in general NP-hard and is sometimes called *Load balancing problem* or
/// *Minimum makespan scheduling*.
///
/// # Scheduler instances
/// There are two types of scheduler variants:
///  1. Approximate solver - `LPT`
///  2. Optimal solver - `BnB`
///
/// ## Approximate solver
/// LPT stands for *Longest Processing Time First* and is an approximation algorithm that runs in
/// `O(n*log(n))` time where `n` is the number of non-preemptive tasks to schedule.
///
/// Approximation factor is `r(LPT) = 1 + 1/k âˆ’ 1/kR` where
///  * `R` is no. resources
///  * `k` is no. tasks assigned to the resource which finishes last
///
/// ### Examples
///
/// Example where a sub-optimal solution is found.
/// ```
/// # extern crate makespan;
/// use makespan::Scheduler;
/// let pts = vec![5., 5., 4., 4., 3., 3., 3.];
/// let (solution, stats) = Scheduler::LPT.schedule(&pts, 3).unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(solution.value, 11.); // opt = 9.
/// assert_eq!(stats.approx_factor, 1.4444444444444444); // 11. < 9. * 1.4444444444444444 = 13.
/// ```
///
/// ## Optimal solver
/// Optimal solver impements Branch and Bound (BnB) Best-first search. This algorithm is complete
/// and optimal, i.e. finds optimal schedule given enough time to run (controlled by `timeout`).
///
/// Because the scheduling problem is known to be NP-hard, it is believed that there is no
/// polynomial algorithm. Then it is not surprising that this implementation runs in `O(R^n)` where
/// `R` is the number of resources and `n` is again the number of tasks.
///
/// As mentioned above, this algorithm uses a Best-first search under the hood which means that
/// nodes to expand in the BnB tree are picked based on a heuristic function `h(N)`. The heuristic
/// is a simple *admissible* estimate of the value of partial solution `N` obtained by scheduling
/// remaining tasks as if the problem was `P |pmtn| C_max` - i.e. relaxes the problem by allowing
/// task preemption. Moreover, in current implementation we allow indefinite number of pauses and
/// resumes and tasks can have inner parallelism (more parts can run at the same time).
///
/// Additional optimization techniques include:
///  * Initial best solution `B` is found by LPT and the search keeps only nodes with `f(N) < f(B)`
///  * Pruning based on `h(N)` (i.e. `h(N) < f(B)` must hold to expand node `N`)
///  * Pruning resource and task symmetries (e.g. with two identical tasks j1, j2 these assignments
///    are symmetric: `[0 <- j1, 1 <- j2] =sym= [0 <- j2, 1 <- j1]`)
///  * Tasks are pre-sorted by processing times (non-increasingly) and BnB then starts with longer
///    tasks first when it selects next task to extend the partial solution with. This heuristic
///    should in theory restrict the space more early in the search and thus help to prune
///    sub-optimal solutions.
///
/// ### Examples
///
/// Example where an optimal solution is better than the one found by LPT.
/// ```
/// # extern crate makespan;
/// use makespan::Scheduler;
/// let pts = vec![5., 5., 4., 4., 3., 3., 3.];
/// let (solution, stats) = Scheduler::BnB { timeout: None }.schedule(&pts, 3).unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(solution.value, 9.);
/// assert!(stats.proved_optimal);
/// ```
